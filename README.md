dailyXBMC is a sister program to XBMCDBR with many changes and added funtionality. If you compile your own XBMC, this is the program for you. With this program you will be able to download the latest XBMC SVN sources, along with your favorite skins and scripts, build the sources, and ftp to your xbox with the click of a button and not have to worry about losing your existing settings.

If you are looking for support, please post your issue under the issues tab here. Or you can visit the thread at XBOX-Scene, or if you can't get to me in any of these ways you can throw me an email at danomoseley@gmail.com
